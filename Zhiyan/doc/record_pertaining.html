        ·s²Ó©úÅé;mso-fareast-language:ZH-TW'>This is what I heave learned: there are five
        constants in the rituals of which none is more important than the sacrifices. The
        Hall of Filial Devotion of our lineage has set two sacrifices in spring and
        autumn to make offerings to the first ancestor. Beyond the first ancestor,
        those of merit and virtue may also be put in the ancestral temple and receive
        sacrifices. However, the income from the temple¡¦s rents is very small. Except
        for the annual regular and miscellaneous expenses, we are not able to make
        plentiful the sacrificial offerings. In the past, the first ancestor Mr. Yi 75<sup>th</sup>,
        being deep in feeling and respecting the ancestors<span class=GramE>, <span
        style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;</span>donated</span><span
        style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>fields to support the sacrifices. The
        whole lineage was impressed by his filial piety and placed Mr. Yi <span
        class=GramE>75<sup>th</sup> <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;</span>himself</span>
        and his grandfather and father well to be worshipped. Each year in the spring
        and autumn his descendants received raw and cooked sacrificial meat. Afterwards
        those donated fields to help with the sacrifices were placed in the temple on
        the basis of this precedent. Mr. [Yi 75<sup>th</sup>] assisted [the temple by
        donating] the fields to pay respect to the ancestors; later generations admired
        his virtue; they thus increased the sacrifice to him and included his
        predecessors [i.e. his grandfather and father] in the sacrifices. Compared to
        those who only care about family, wife, and children, and do not think of the
        ancestral sacrifices, the difference is enormous? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
        ·s²Ó©úÅé;mso-fareast-language:ZH-TW'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
        ·s²Ó©úÅé;mso-fareast-language:ZH-TW'>Our lineage admires his model and has continually
        added supporting fields. Since Mr. Ming 10<sup>th</sup> and Mr. <span
        class=SpellE>Hui</span> 133<sup>rd</sup>, each generation has had some people
        who made donations. In the temple the first ones to do this were Mr. <span
        class=SpellE>Hui</span> 188<sup>th</sup>, <span class=SpellE>Kuan</span> 121<sup>st</sup>,
        <span class=SpellE>Kuan</span> 137<sup>th</sup>, <span class=SpellE>Kuan</span>
        168<sup>th</sup> et al.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>In 1740 we made
        the rule that all those who gave supporting fields for additional sacrifices
        were to be given sacrificial meat according to this precedent. Those who gave
        supporting fields that were infertile or smaller than one <span class=SpellE><i
        style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>mou</i></span> [1/6<sup>th</sup> of an acre<span
        class=GramE>]could</span> not be placed in the temple. This is clearly recorded
        in the compact; it is indeed just and proper. One fears that with the passage
        of time evidence of the contracts for the donation of supporting fields will be
        lost, and that someone might take advantage of this to provoke trouble, or
        might after the fact raise the price of the supporting field and put the extra
        money in his own pocket, or even that greedy people might take advantage of the
        loss of the evidence to occupy the supporting fields as their own without
        calling attention to the fact. These various frauds are obvious and identifiable.
        Today, on the occasion of the recompilation of the genealogy, [we] respectfully
        record clearly each donation of a supporting field in chronological order and append
        this to the genealogy, in the hope that the later generations will not forget
        the meaning of deepening the root and respecting the origin. May they never change
        <span class=GramE>it.</span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
