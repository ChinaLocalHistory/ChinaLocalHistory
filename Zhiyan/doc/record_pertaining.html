        <p style='line-height:200%'> This is what I heave learned: there are five
constants in the rituals of which none is more important than the sacrifices. The
Hall of Filial Devotion of our lineage has set two sacrifices in spring and
autumn to make offerings to the first ancestor. Beyond the first ancestor,
those of merit and virtue may also be put in the ancestral temple and receive
sacrifices. However, the income from the templeâ€™s rents is very small. Except
for the annual regular and miscellaneous expenses, we are not able to make
plentiful the sacrificial offerings. In the past, the first ancestor Mr. Yi 75<sup>th</sup>,
being deep in feeling and respecting the ancestors<span class=GramE>, <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;</span>donated</span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>fields to support the sacrifices. The
whole lineage was impressed by his filial piety and placed Mr. Yi <span
class=GramE>75<sup>th</sup> <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;</span>himself</span>
and his grandfather and father well to be worshipped. Each year in the spring
and autumn his descendants received raw and cooked sacrificial meat. Afterwards
those donated fields to help with the sacrifices were placed in the temple on
the basis of this precedent. Mr. [Yi 75<sup>th</sup>] assisted [the temple by
donating] the fields to pay respect to the ancestors; later generations admired
his virtue; they thus increased the sacrifice to him and included his
predecessors [i.e. his grandfather and father] in the sacrifices. Compared to
those who only care about family, wife, and children, and do not think of the
ancestral sacrifices, the difference is enormous?</p> 

        <p style='line-height:200%'>Our lineage admires his model and has continually
          added supporting fields. Since Mr. Ming 10<sup>th</sup> and Mr. <span
          class=SpellE>Hui</span> 133<sup>rd</sup>, each generation has had some people
          who made donations. In the temple the first ones to do this were Mr. <span
          class=SpellE>Hui</span> 188<sup>th</sup>, <span class=SpellE>Kuan</span> 121<sup>st</sup>,
          <span class=SpellE>Kuan</span> 137<sup>th</sup>, <span class=SpellE>Kuan</span>
          168<sup>th</sup> et al.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>In 1740 we made
          the rule that all those who gave supporting fields for additional sacrifices
          were to be given sacrificial meat according to this precedent. Those who gave
          supporting fields that were infertile or smaller than one <span class=SpellE><i
          style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>mou</i></span> [1/6<sup>th</sup> of an acre<span
          class=GramE>]could</span> not be placed in the temple. This is clearly recorded
          in the compact; it is indeed just and proper. One fears that with the passage
          of time evidence of the contracts for the donation of supporting fields will be
          lost, and that someone might take advantage of this to provoke trouble, or
          might after the fact raise the price of the supporting field and put the extra
          money in his own pocket, or even that greedy people might take advantage of the
          loss of the evidence to occupy the supporting fields as their own without
          calling attention to the fact. These various frauds are obvious and identifiable.
          Today, on the occasion of the recompilation of the genealogy, [we] respectfully
          record clearly each donation of a supporting field in chronological order and append
          this to the genealogy, in the hope that the later generations will not forget
          the meaning of deepening the root and respecting the origin. May they never change it.</p>
