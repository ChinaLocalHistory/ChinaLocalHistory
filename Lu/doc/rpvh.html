foundation [for the descendants’ prosperity.] Filial and benevolent descendants
continue [the merits and virtues of] their ancestors and accomplish what [their

Duke created the great beginning and bequeathed it to us his descendants, the
sacrificial rituals for our first migrant ancestor [of the entire <span

nothing that we can do about the passing of time, thus when we gather
altogether we have almost no way to discern near kin from distant kin. [As a
result,] the lineage came to be divided into the northern branch and the

If the proper emotional [ties among family members] are dispersed to this

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:40.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:PMingLiU'>Therefore, in accord with
the common desire of the human heart, [we] have now set forth a great plan.
Relying on the leadership of the family heads, [we] have today arrived at an
agreement. We ask that all take an oath in front of our ancestors and not argue
against it with your personal opinions. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:40.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:PMingLiU'>Counting the average
income, we can raise three hundred [<span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>strings
of cash</span>] annually. Together with voluntary contributions from all
quarters this will amount to several thousand strings. Since we know that this
initial plan has a sound basis we do not need to worry about it not being
realized. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:40.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:PMingLiU'>Although there are
differences in degrees of kinship, is this not the proper way to gather what
has already dispersed and combine what has been separated? It is true that
there are differences in wealth, but everybody is willing to spend [great
amount on] their son’s or daughter’s marriage. Can one <span class=GramE>has</span>
to give priority to a short-term calculation for one’s own family at the
expense of a grand and permanent plan for ten thousand generations of
descendants. If anyone says that this project is too big [for our family], [my
reply must be that] our efforts will be rewarded with great success [in
building our communal hall, i.e., Planting Virtue Hall in the future] within
five years. If anyone says that this project is too costly and complicated, [my
reply must be that it is not true] as long as we all can cooperate without
disunion. If anyone harbors a selfish thought, let him first quell [this] for
not only is he turning his back on the intentions of the ancestors in building
halls, he is also giving later generations a reason to condemn [you]. We must
enter into a forma agreement together and not miss this opportunity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-fareast-font-family:PMingLiU'>, 13<sup>th</sup> gen., 1395-1445). In terms
of the five degrees of mourning we are not distant [kin], but since this
ancestor did not establish a place where [his descendants to the fifth] could
sleep [under the same roof], the five branches [directly descended from him]
did not have a place to live altogether. Since none of these five branches
established a place [where the descendants of each branch] could sleep [under
the same roof], the fourteen sub-branches succeeding [these five branches] also
do not have a place where [the descendants of each sub-branch] can live
altogether. At present the [descendants] have increased like cloud, but since
their residences are scattered, our sons, grandsons, and brothers barely
recognize their relatives. Since there is no chance to gather except [for the
annual sacrifice at] the main ancestral hall, when we do assemble we feel
distance from each other. This is the origin of [the problem.]<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:40.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:PMingLiU'>Moreover, the most
unpleasant thing is there is no place for sacrifices devoted to our common
ancestor [i.e., Lu Zhang]<span class=GramE>,</span> we have to arrange [the
utensils and food for sacrifices] in the middle the family temple where he is
surrounded by the other ancestors. This makes it very embarrassing for our
common ancestor to receive sacrifices exclusively. Given this discomfort should
we not make a place just for him?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:40.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:PMingLiU'>Recently, we have discussed
building a communal hall with the aims of offering annual sacrifices to our
common ancestor and, at the same time, of tying us, his descendants, together.
When the suggestion [for building a communal hall] first came out, most of us
agreed with one voice. Given this sentiment we know that we cannot cancel [this
plan.] It is not easy, however, to collect the considerable amount of money to
cover expenses. [Accordingly,] the meeting of family elders has agreed on the following:
First, preserve and accumulate the surplus from selling pine trees; second,
strongly encourage the wise and wealthy to voluntarily contribute; third,
charge each adult male in each branch and <span class=GramE>sub-branch</span> a
certain amount of silver. , When we appoint an honest person with an ability to
manage the finances we may anticipate that in five years we will have the
resources to build [this communal hall.] We will then begin construction in a
timely fashion. [When finished,] we will have a building for annual sacrifices,
and all the members can gather in its grand courtyard. This will be a
magnificent sight for a hundred generations. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:40.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:PMingLiU'>Our ancestor has
consciousness; he ought to respond to our efforts with full approval. We shall
hold a separate deliberation on the date to begin construction. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
