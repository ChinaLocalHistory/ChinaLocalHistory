    <div class = Section2>
        <p>[Note: The term translated as "city god temple" is literally the "temple
            of [the god of the] walls (<i>cheng</i><span style='font-style:normal'>)
            and moats (</span><i>huang</i><span style='font-style:normal'>)." In the
            first part of the translation we use </span><i>cheng</i><span
        style='font-style:normal'> and </span><i>huang</i><span style='font-style:normal'> for
            reasons that will be apparent.]</span></p> 
          <p>Examining into antiquity I find that the <u>Book of Change</u> says " The <i>cheng</i><span style='font-style:normal'> falls
              back on the </span><i>huang;</i><span
        style='font-style:normal'>" the commentary glosses </span><i>huang</i><span
        style='font-style:normal'> as "moat." In the <u>Glosses on the Erya [Vocabulary]</u> </span><i>huang</i><span style='font-style:normal'> is
              "empty." The gloss has "what is without water is a </span><i>huang</i><span
        style='font-style:normal'>." These are the first appearances of the term </span><i>cheng
              huang</i><span style='font-style:normal'> in the Classics. According to
              the <u>Rites of Zhou</u> the Minister of Religion's sacrifices to the earth
              spirits, in addition to the blood sacrifices, sacrifices put in the earth,
              and sacrifices out in the water, there is the ritual dismemberment of the
              victim [to get rid of evil] for all things of the four quarters. The [Canon
              of Yao] in <u>Book of Documents</u> has "They make offerings to all the
              spirits." The <u>Book of Rites</u> has "Those who hold the empire make
              offerings to the many spirits." But none of the commentaries on these passages
              ever mentioned </span><i>cheng huang</i><span style='font-style:normal'>.
              Thus before the Zhou and Qin dynasties not only was there no such temple
              there was not an offering with this name either. The <u>Spring and Autumn
              Annals</u> frequently does not desist from recording the building of walls
              and digging of moats. Now when the kings or dukes created defenses, building
              walls to protect dwellings or moats to hold back barbarian horsemen, then
              the value of their deeds to the people was equal to that of the mountains
              and forests, rivers and marshes, and mounds and hills being able to produce
              the clouds to make the wind and rain. And so how could it be that if all
              the wondrous places in the universe have ghosts and spirits residing, that
              for the protection of the capital of mighty Tangxi there alone would not
              be an intelligent and moral deity in charge of the place? </span></p> 
          <p>But why was it that [the ancients] made offerings at the winter sacrifice
            to cats and tigers to repay them for their contribution to farming [by killing
            rats and boars], that the wolf and otter as different as they are honored
            for sacrificing to their ancestors origins, and it even happened that the
            state of Lu made offerings to the seagull, Guo to the spirit descending to
            Shen, Qin sacrificed at the Western Altar, and there were even those who
            allowed licentious sacrifices, and yet the <i>cheng huang</i><span style='font-style:normal'> is
            missing [in the ancient records]. Is this because the records of the ancient
            rituals were abbreviated and incomplete? Or is this because the offering
            were irregular, such as the Yong, Gong, Yue, and Rang [sacrifices in antiquity],
            so that even if there were occasionally held, the ground would be cleared,
            the altar removed, and it would be included in the offerings to all spirits
            without a specific status? Wang Chongjian [1607-1678] in explaining the Eight
            Winter Solstice offerings took the "</span><i>shui</i><span style='font-style:normal'> (water)
            and </span><i>yong </i><span style='font-style:normal'>(wall)" offering to
            refer to the </span><i>cheng</i><span
        style='font-style:normal'> and </span><i>huang</i><span style='font-style:normal'>.
            Now it is plausible to take </span><i>yong </i><span style='font-style:normal'>as </span><i>cheng</i><span style='font-style:normal'>,
            but to take </span><i>shui</i><span
        style='font-style:normal'> as </span><i>huang</i><span style='font-style:normal'> obviously
            is at odds with the commentaries on the Classics [which gloss </span><i>huang</i><span
        style='font-style:normal'> as a dry moat] so this is not the final word. When
            we look into the histories we find that in the second year of the Chiwu era
            of the state of Wu [AD 239] they built the Temple of the Walls and Moats
            of Wuhu, thus it is evident that this began during the Three Kingdoms period.
            The previous edition of the gazetteer argued that it began in the Tang dynasty
            on the basis of Li Yangbing's Inscription for Dangtu Temple and a stele in
            seal script in [neighboring] Jinyun County, but that was a mistake in research.
            After this Northern Qi in Yingzhou they also built this temple. In the Shaoding
            era [1228-1233] of the Song an [imperial] plaque was given [to a City God
            temple]. In the Duanping era [1234-1236] a city god was officially given
            the noble title of Marquis of Xianying [=Respond Efficaciously]. In the Hongwu
            era [1368-1398 of the Ming] the title was changed to Earl of Xianyou [=Protect
            Efficaciously], but soon the title was removed and it was referred to as
            the "God of the Walls and Moats of such-and-such prefecture or county." Our
            dynasty has followed this and the temples spread throughout the world.</span></p> 
          <p>The gazetteer for this temple in Tangxi says that no one can specifically
            say when it began. Now when we were taking down the wall at the back of the
            main hall we found a stele with an inscription for a "living" shrine for
            Lord Song. Its text says that when the county was established by taking territory
            from four other counties, Jinhua, Lanxi, Longyou, and Suichang Song was chosen
            to be responsible for this place. In two or three years the county seat,
            the school, the offices, the altars, and the temples where all erected, thus
            it is very clear that this was built by Song. During the Kangxi period [1662-1722]
            of our dynasty. Magistrates Ke, Yang, and Song and the county gentry Zhang
            Keyuan and his son all renovated it in succession. In addition they set aside
            rental income to cover expenses in the long term. From the Chenghua era [1465-1487]
            to today, however, several hundred years have passed. Rain and wind have
            battered it, birds and rats have nested in it, it is in such dangerous condition
            that it will not last another day. In the summer of the <i>wuzi</i><span style='font-style:normal'> year
            [1828] I was appointed to administer this county. Soon after I arrived I
            first carried out the rites and made offerings. I saw that it was in a terrible
            state of decay. I immediately contributed funds and called on the local gentry
            Chen Xiangyao and others to supervise the work. They made temporary repairs
            to the roof and shored up the supports to make the god safe. Considering
            that a major renovation would have been a huge project, beyond the capabilities
            of the populace, and that as the <u>Zuo Commentary</u> says: "First help
            improve the situation of the populace and then spend energies on the spirits,"
            my humble intention was to wait for the proper time. Luckily the harvest
            was plentiful and there were not natural disasters. Prayers for rain and
            sun were answered. [The harvest was so plentiful that] it was stored in the
            fields and left uncovered on the embankments; the farmers and craftsmen were
            celebrating in the villages and the merchants were plentiful in the markets.
            There were hymns of praise that this was the result of my virtuous administration.
            But how would I dare to claim credit for blessings from the god? Now when
            the god had protects a place against disaster and tribulation and brings
            good fortune to the people like this, we should grasp the moment and complete
            the project without delay; it was entirely proper that when the time was
            right we should give him a decent dwelling, thus to honor his virtue and
            repay his achievements.</span></p> 
          <p>Thus I gathered the officials and the gentry elders and planned it, and
            contributed a large sum to lead the way. Once general opinion was settled,
            within weeks and months what was contributed to help mounted into the thousands
            and ten-thousands. This project began in the fifth month of the <i>jichou</i><span style='font-style:normal'> year
            of the Daoguang era [1829] and was finished in the sixth month of the </span><i>xinmao</i><span
        style='font-style:normal'> year [1831]. The old style of the halls was maintained
            but the galleries were enlarged. The whole layout was made even brighter
            and more imposing. The stone was set, the wood cut, and it was so firm, delicate
            and grand that after the efforts for this reconstruction we will never need
            to do it again. The stone has ground to a fine polish, the wood carved to
            perfection, and the ceiling decoration is beautiful with golds and greens
            whose luminosity dazzles the age. And there is the dignity of the god's image,
            the ranks of the guards, the statues of the women in the inner apartment,
            and the officers for reward and punishment in the side galleries. Governing
            the human world and ruling the nether world is the same. In the unseen realms
            there is one who is in charge of celebrating the good and making the evil
            suffer, bringing good fortune to the good and ill to the licentious. By serving
            the spirits with the way of serving men the simple folk are made to pay attention
            and take warning " this is the subtle intent of establishing moral instruction
            with the way of the spirits. Those who also serving here at this time were
            School Instructor Mr. Shen Baolin, Assistant Instructor Mr. Shou Yumin, former
            Assistant Instructors Mr. Qin Jing, Mr. Gao Xifan, Police Chief Mr. Li Yangqing,
            former Police Chief Mr. Jiang Quan, all are honest and fair. Much help was
            received from their prompting the gentry to manage the matter; they took
            responsibility for various aspects and worked hard from start to finish.
            Although the costs went beyond several ten-thousands, not a scrap or shaving
            was wasted. I thus further commend the gentlemen of Tangxi, who like the
            good and are willing to contribute, who are principled and public-spirited,
            and who helped make this possible. When the building was finished the gentry
            asked for some words to engrave on a stele. I thereupon turned to the Classics
            and commentaries, histories and gazetteers, to trace the origin of the name
            and meaning and to correct misunderstandings about its beginning, and in
            addition [mentioned] the traces of earlier renovations, and the greatness
            of the gentlemen in joining their efforts for a common purpose and of an
            achievement that will be permanently visible. The names of the gentry who
            managed the matter and those who contributed are separately registered on
            a stele to show the future. </span></p> 
          <p>However, there is a cycle of what was once new becoming old and what was
            once complete becoming faulty and back again. If we wish to attract the god's
            gifts endlessly, then this is what I expect of the successors.</p>
