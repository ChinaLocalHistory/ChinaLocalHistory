    <div class = Section2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beginning
            in the <i>xinyou</i><span style='font-style:normal'> year of the Xianfeng
            era [1861] Hong Xiuchuan and Yang Xiucheng rebelled. Calamity afflicted living
            beings through almost all the country. The southeast in particular was badly
            hit. They entered Zhejiang Province from Anhui Province, arriving in Jinhua
            Prefecture and Lanxi County first. Jinhua Prefecture was occupied by a false
            king [of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom]. Tangxi being a strategic juncture
            of Jinhua and Qu prefectures and Longyou and Lanxi counties, it was held
            by the Assisting Celestial Righteousness [an official title in the Taiping
            Heavenly Kingdom]. They took down the monasteries, temples and mansions in
            the four districts [of Tangxi] to build the false king's palace. They slaughtered
            the people; there was no evil they did not do, and the entire populace fled.
            This was in 1862, for these events see Zeng Guofan's <u>Record of Major Events</u>.
            At this time there were rebels everywhere in the prefectures and counties
            of Jiangxi and Zhejiang provinces. Only Qu prefecture, with its high walls
            and deep moats, had not yet been lost. Zuo Zongtang was Pacification Commissioner
            for Zhejiang, Jiang Guomin was General Protector, headquartered at Kecheng.
            They led the subordinate commanders, Generals Bao Chao, etc., assembling
            in a great camp at Luo and Yang river markets to march on Tangxi city. They
            secretly cut a way through while openly let loose fire arrows. It was some
            months before they subdued [Tangxi]. The two offices of the human world and
            the underworld, the Confucian Temple and academy together with the false
            king's palace had all been put to the torch and had become scorched earth.
            The only thing that survived was the western quarter of the city where life
            resumed. Once Tangxi city had fallen then everything else was easy. Quzhou
            broke the siege, in Jinhua prefecture [the rebels] escaped. The hinterland
            of Longyou and Lanxi, Eastern and western Zhejiang, the whole province was
            cleansed. The <u>Rites of Zhou</u> says: After a great battle there will
            be a great pestilence, and after a great pestilence there will be a great
            sickness. The loss of population was such that only twenty or thirty percent
            remained. By 1866-67 the villages were secure. Officials and gentry worked
            together and the old examination hall was converted to government offices.
            The public recommended the gentry Wang Baoying and gentry from the four districts
            to rebuild the Confucian temple and the county [City God] temple. The reconstructions
            were of large plan. But [despite the fact that] the beams and columns of
            the county temple were the largest in the eight counties of Jinhua, the had
            used the maple, the wrong kind of wood for this purpose. Maple grows quickly
            and is easy to cut down, but with time it had been infested by insects. They
            came out from inside the wood, leaving holes as packed together as stars
            in the sky. It was rotten and could not take the weight and was urgently
            in need of repair. From the Tongzhi period to today is already over sixty
            years. If it should collapse then even the roof tiles would not survive.
            So during the spring and summer of 1925 the county assembly gave serious
            thought to this matter and stated it clearly to the government. The held
            several meetings and recommended that I be the manager and the gentry Zong
            Mingqian be the vice-manager.</span></p> 
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Housing
            the god is something I was happy to do. We then had a gathering of officials
            and gentry at the county temple. We first did fund raising, then we gave
            people tasks. From now on we should sweep clean the accumulated problems
            of the past and always take the words "Fulfill One's Duty" as our guide.
            There was to be no excess expenses and no over-requisitioning of labor. Raising
            money was not easy; material resources were a problem. For the columns and
            beams we had to use camphor, cryptomeria, and catalpa trunks. For the main
            gate and the eaves of the verandas and pavilion we had to use stone columns
            to support the load. Since we have made a great effort to do it well, we
            will never have to do it again. It is ten times more impressive than before.
            With gold accents and vermilion lacquer, it is bright and fresh. Although
            we say it is "renovated" in fact it is the same as a new construction. Although
            during the struggle between northern and southern armies in the twelfth month
            last year there were battles in the city and districts, there was not the
            slightest damage to the county city god temple. There was a deity providing
            hidden protection. Truly this is what is called "there is a ruler in the
            realm of the unseen." The work began in the middle of winter in 1925 and
            was complete at the end of winter in 1927. In total it cost slightly over
            14,000 silver dollars and in total we had collected slightly over 14,000
            silver dollars. Popular sentiment was enthusiastic in support of this project.
            [Its success] completely depended on getting the right people. The gentry
            Zong Mingqian was vice-manager and concurrently chief accountant. He oversaw
            all crucial matters and was good at economizing. The gentry Wang Ding was
            the day to day manager; he gave it all his strength and thought and was never
            afraid of hardship. Mr. Zhu Pangui and Mr. Ying Jinhe managed the wood; they
            are elderly yet vigorous. Others, including the gentry Liu Buqing and Gong
            Futong assisted with diligence; they were of the greatest help. For something to
            be accomplished does not depend on there being a lot of people. I have written
            it all down so that it will not be forgotten. This is my record. </p>
