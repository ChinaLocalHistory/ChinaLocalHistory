    <div class = Section2>
        <p>There are offerings to spirits, as in Buddhist and Daoist temples, whose
            magnificence parallel to the temples to the uncrowned king Confucius and
            which for generations have been offering vegetarian sacrifices rather than
            blood sacrifices. As for the multitude of shrines and informal temples, many
            of them mystify the stories about them in order to delude the foolish common
            people, so that they all rush to seek the assistance of the spirit-power.
            How could it be thus? </p> 
          <p>In addition the people of Tangxi frequent the City God Temple. Every year
            before the 15th day of the 4th month, those in charge collect crowds, some
            put on operas and create a clamor, some decorate frames with festoons as
            lofty artificial mountain to the point that the sound of flute and drum reaches
            into the suburbs. This goes on for several days without stop. They collect
            precious objects to put on display in the main hall, some of which are worth
            hundreds, to say nothing of the glut of other offerings, such as sacrifices
            of millet and ham hocks. Could it be the spirit-power of the god that causes
            this, or is it in fact a local custom that has continued, a precedent that
            has been honored, and which no one has abolished. Alas. Certainly a god with
            spirit-power could not bear that our people should be so wasteful.</p>
