        <dt>1. Information about Mr. Li</dt>
        <dd> a.
            He is from Lizhai in Dongyang. He's 82. He graduated from college and served
            as a junior high school teacher in Tangxi. He came to Tangxi in 1950 and
            so the information he told us about the pre-49 layout of the temple is dubious.
            He may have been remembering the layout of the Dongyang city god temple.</dd> 
            <dd> b.
            He knew some basic information about the history of city gods. He knew that
            city gods did not appear until the Tang/Song and he also knew the details
            of Ming Taizu's ritual reforms concerning city gods.</dd> 
            <dd> c.
            His account of how the people conceive of the city god in Tangxi was somewhat
            inconsistent. When asked whether the city god had any power over the weather
            he replied that it did not. However, he said that people prayed to the city
            god for rain during times of drought. He also said that the city god simply
            determined one's fate after death. But then he demonstrated how to ask the
            city god for predictions and advice concerning one's future with prayer sticks.</dd> 
            <dd> d.
            He said that he didn't believe in the city god. When asked why the people
            wanted to restore the temple, he said that it was due to their beliefs. He
            claimed that the city god was a <i>shen </i><span style='font-style:normal'>and
            had nothing to do with Buddhism or Daoism.</span></dd> 
            <dt>2. Temple Layout</dt> 
            <dd>  a.
            The city god's office is in the main hall. He resides in the inner quarters
            (<i>qingdian</i><span
        style='font-style:normal'>) with his family. In the inner quarters Song Yue is
            seated on the right, his parents are in the middle and his wife is on the
            left.</span></dd> 
            <dd>  b.
            Mr. Li claims that the ceilings of the temple were all painted and carved
            prior to 49. The pillar brackets were carved by people from Linghai rather
            than Dongyang because Linghai carvers were cheaper. He says that the 1925
            renovation cost 100,000 yuan. The model of how the temple used to look was
            reconstructed from memory.</dd> 
            <dd>  c.
            Old ladies in the village collected donations for the 'reward the good and
            punish the evil' displays in the main hall. He claims that they designed
            the displays. Prior to 49 the 10 bays in the display area contained the ten
            gods of hell. Some of the gods had statues and some were painted on the wall.</dd>  
            <dd>  d.
            The temple design was supposedly modeled on the city god temple in Suzhou.</dd>  
            <dt>3. Renovation and Upkeep</dt> 
            <dd>  a.
            Mr. Li claims that the <i>xianzhang</i><span style='font-style:normal'> sensed
            that the people wanted to have the temple returned to them and restored and
            so he initiated the application process for the temple to become a protected
            cultural relic. He at first said that the money to pay for the renovation
            came completely from private donations. However, he later admitted that the
            province contributed 250,000 yuan.</span></dd>  
            <dd> b.
            He claims that the upkeep of the temple is supported by donations. The government
            does not contribute any money for festivals. </dd> 
            <dd> c.
            He would not give us any concrete information about the <i>miaohui </i><span
        style='font-style:normal'>or temple association. He claimed that there was a </span><i>miaohui, </i><span style='font-style:normal'>but
            he implied that they did little or nothing to organize festival activities.
            He argued that they just happen naturally.</span></dd> 
            <dt>4. Festivals and Temple activities</dt>
          <dd> a.
            The large statue in the main hall does not leave the temple. The smaller
            inner quarter statue goes out on ritual processions to inspect the city on
            the 16<sup>th</sup> day of the fourth month (Song Yue's birthday) and the
            15<sup>th</sup> day of the first month.</dt>  
            <dd>  b.
            On Song Yue's birthday, people fill the temple and stay there overnight.
            Mr. Li claims that people come from all over the area to celebrate his birthday.
            The people offer incense and burn candles as they pray to the city god for
            protection. The city god can protect people from ghosts and other dangers. </dd> 
            <dd>  c.
            Mr. Li claims that people conceive of the city god according to the hierarchy
            established by Ming Taizu. The top god is the Beijing city god. According
            to Mr. Li, the Beijing city god is the ruler of the underworld.</dd> 
            <dd>  d.
            The plays are performed for the city god. People have to stand on either
            side of the courtyard during the performances so that they do not obstruct
            his view. They started to perform the plays again after 1979.</dd> 
            <dd>  e.
            The portable shrine (<i>xiangting; longting</i><span style='font-style:normal'>)
            is new. Mr. Li said that the old portable shrine had a slogan wishing the
            emperor a long life engraved on it. He says that the city god image was carried
            behind it during the ritual processions through the town. (I'm not that clear
            if I understood his meaning here). </span></dd> 
            <dd>  f.
            Mr. Li showed us how to pray to the city god for advice. After kneeling before
            the city god, you pick up the container of prayer sticks and circle it around
            the incense burner three times. Then you gently shake the container until
            one stick falls out. You take it to the front of the temple to get an answer
            that corresponds to the prayer stick. </dd>
