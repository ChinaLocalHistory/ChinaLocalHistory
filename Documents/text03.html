    <div class = Section2>
        <p style='line-height:200%'>In the past there were many stories about the city-gods
            of every place, that they were men who after death had become gods. For example,
            the city god of Beijing was the loyal minister at the end of Song dynasty,
            Wen Tianxiang who after his capture was put to death in Beijing, while the
            Hangzhou city-god was the former surveillance commissioner of Zhejiang, Zhou
            Xin, who became famous for his integrity and was wrongfully put to death.
            While the city gods mentioned in these tales were still alive, some made
            meritorious contributions to their dynasties, some showed kindness to the
            people, some were loyal and upright, some were capable and honest. They were
            revered as gods in order to commemorate them.</p> 
          <p style='line-height:200%'> The
            Tangxi city god is Song Yue, and his story is recorded in the Tangxi County
            Gazetteer. Inside the temple, at the side of the stage, engraved on a stone
            pillar as part of a couplet, there is also the phrase: &quot;The god born in Zuocheng.&quot;Song
            Yue, courtesy name Wenbo, was from Zuocheng city in Weihui prefecture (in
            what is now Henan), and once served as magistrate of Tang county. In the
            sixth year of the Chenghua reign period during the Ming dynasty (1470) when
            it was decided to establish Tangxi county, they appointed Song Yue as county
            magistrate, and he assumed the post in the sixth month of the following year.
            He was Tangxi's first county magistrate.</p> 
          <p style='line-height:200%'>  When
            Song Yue took up his post, because this was a recently created county, it
            originally lacked everything, he selected an area among motley trees and,
            in the forested Guan Mountain where tigers and wolves prowled, created the
            a county seat, the county yamen, the magistrate's residence, the Confucian
            temple and county school, the temple to Guan Di and the city god temple and
            so on ' all the facilities that a county should have, and in addition he
            laid out the streets and lanes and the marketplace. All this he completed
            in his three year term, and the building of the county seat made fast progress
            . Moreover, &quot;Of things there was no rash expenditure/Of men there was no
            exhaustion of labor&quot;, and so the merit he achieved was very great, and he
            was praised by the times. Thus, the chancellor at the time, Shang Lu, wrote
            a &quot;Record of building the county seat of Tangxi&quot;, commemorating these matters.</p> 
          <p style='line-height:200%'>Song Yue, because the county had been built for
            the first time and the county population was exhausted and he thought that
            &quot;The people are the basis of the state, if the people are exhausted, then
            the basis is injured, so he memorialized requesting<span
        style='color:red'> </span>a reduction in taxes and corv'e service for five years.&quot;
            This reduction of money and grain tax and corv'e service for five years,
            let the people of the county lighten their burdens and was a real benefit.
            This one measure, which undoubtedly augmented the group spirit of the people
            who originally belonged to the four counties and added to the new county
            cohesion with the people, was productive of a very good effect. </p> 
          <p style='line-height:200%'>  Soon
            after the establishment of Tangxi, the area produced a metropolitan graduate
            (<i>jinshi</i><span
        style='font-style:normal'>) (under the examination system of those days, once
            every three years approximately three hundred men in the entire country were
            selected as metropolitan graduates), so this was an excellent event. Moreover,
            &quot;Auspicious millet was produced in Qinyang (modern Xilizhou), one stem two
            ears, even eight or nine ears ' one hundred such stems! The next year the
            garden behind the city offices also<span style='color:red'> </span>produced
            several tens of stems.&quot; This sort of phenomenon where a single stalk produces
            two or several ears, was always seen as a good omen in our country's olden
            days, and was a seldom occurring strange phenomenon.</span></p> 
          <p style='line-height:200%'> These
            events all occurred during Song Yue's administration, in which the harmonious
            atmosphere produced auspicious portents, which the people thought were brought
            forth by his virtuous administration as it had increased the marvelous atmosphere.
            Moreover, as an administrator he was honest and diligent , and when they
            were building the county seat &quot;He wore a tattered robe and ate vegetarian
            food, he rose before dawn to oversee matters&quot; and &quot;he also decided cases
            intelligently, the court had no pending cases and there were no people wrongly
            incarcerated &quot;, and thus he gained the reverence and affection of the
            county's people. Even during his lifetime they built a shrine to him and
            set up a tablet commemorating his &quot;virtuous administration&quot;. After
            his death, they also honored him as the city god, and further they set his
            birthday, the 16<sup>th</sup> of the fourth month as the day the city god
            makes his progress, and they hold the temple festival, which has carried
            through to the present - this is the origin of [what is today <span style='font-size:13.0pt'>called]
            the</span> &quot;meeting for exchange&quot; [the annual great market] on that
            day.</p> 
          <p style='line-height:200%'> To
            die and then become a god is of course a sort of legend. But it can be compared
            to today's way of setting up bronze statues or memorial hall to great and
            famous men in remembrance of them, which is of course a contemporary means
            of showing appreciation and commemorating excellence.</p>
