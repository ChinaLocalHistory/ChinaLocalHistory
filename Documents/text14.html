        <p>Entry on the City God Temple</p> 
        <p>At the beginning of the Hongwu reign period (1368-1398) the county City Gods were enfeoffed with the rank of Earl. Later this was dropped and the reference was only made to the god of this county's walls and moats. There was no special sacrifice for him; he was included in the official sacrifices
          to the mountains and rivers. When the sacrifice to malicious spirits was
          performed<span style='color:red'>, </span>[City Gods] were treated as the
          main object of worship.</p>
